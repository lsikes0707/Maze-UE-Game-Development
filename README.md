# UE Game Development
 Maze game created with Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints.

 Player must find the entrance to the maze, navigate it through it with many locked doors that require specific switches to get the tower on the far side of the map. Player can use a light source they can plant or destroy with Left side _Alt_ or _Shift_ keys respectively. There is more than one way to get through the maze, but one comes with a pretty picture.
